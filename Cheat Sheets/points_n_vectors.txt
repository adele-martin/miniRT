In raytracing, points and vectors are both essential but serve distinct purposes in 3D space, which is why we need
x, y and z coordinates for both.

Here's why each is important and how they differ:

 A point is a fixed position in 3D space:
 sphere center, camera position, light position. 3D space requires three coordinates to describe any location accurately.

 A vector defines a direction, not a location.

Field of View: size of the viewport and how far away they are from camera
